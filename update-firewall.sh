# A robust firewall script for a server behind Cloudflare.
# - Allows SSH traffic from anywhere (relies on key-based auth).
# - Locks down web traffic (80/443) to ONLY Cloudflare IPs.
# --- NEW: Explicitly allows traffic from Docker interfaces to ensure inter-container communication.
# - This script is idempotent and can be run safely multiple times.
